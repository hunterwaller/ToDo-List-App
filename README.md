# ToDo list

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This program is a simple list maker.  You can type whatever you want into the text box and press enter.  This will append your item to the list.  Any item in the list you want to remove, you can simply click and it will be removed</p>

<h1>How to Run</h1>
<p>Install all of the files, keeping them in the same folder.  Open command prompt and move into the directory.  Run 'http-server' to open up a local host.  Open your web browser and search 'localhost:8080' in the search bar.</p>

<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>The website as it is currently is a little ugly, so in the future I will be revamping the style sheet and make it look nicer.</p>
